# Subdivision algorithm implementation (recursive until conjecture is solved on the block set)
#    The blocks that passed on for further consideration would be passed in (see notes for algorithm details)
#    This method would be optimized for fast object condition consideration (in Cython) or possibly evaluating
#    multiple levels at the same time
